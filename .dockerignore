# CRITICAL: We ignore the 'models' directory. 
# Model files are huge. If you don't ignore this, Docker tries to "upload" 
# the model to the build context, which takes forever and wastes space.

# Ignore the git history. We only need the current files, not the 
# entire history of changes.

# Ignore automation scripts and GitHub workflows. 
# The container doesn't need to know about your CI/CD pipelines.
